# """#Name service for name registration and resolution (ports: 137/udp and 137/tcp).
Datagram distribution service for connectionless communication (port: 138/udp).
Session service for connection-oriented communication (port: 139/tcp).

Every machine should have a name inside the NetBios network. To request a name, a machine should send a "Name Query" packet in broadcast and if anyone answer that it is already using that name, the machine can use that name. If there is a Name Service server, the computer could ask the Name Service server if someone is using the name that it wants to use.
