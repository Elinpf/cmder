Notes
# """#Firstly, Kerberos is an authentication protocol, not authorization. In other words, it allows to identify each user, who provides a secret password, however, it does not validates to which resources or services can this user access.
Kerberos is used in Active Directory. In this platform, Kerberos provides information about the privileges of each user, but it is responsability of each service to determine if the user has access to its resources.
